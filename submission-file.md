## Introduction to Application

Water Reminder is a mobile app designed to help users stay hydrated. In busy daily life, many people often forget to drink water regularly. This app helps users improve this situation by setting personalized reminders. Users can customize their daily water intake based on their health goals and lifestyle. The app also tracks the user's drinking history and provides users with insights through statistics and trend graphs to promote healthy habits. In addition to the reminder function, it can also synchronize data with a cup with a water level sensor. The cup uses firebase to allow users to automatically upload drinking data after drinking water.
