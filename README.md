# Water Reminder
As we all know, water is the most important substance needed for human life, NHS recommends that people should aim to drink 1.2L to 2L of water a day. But for some people, drinking enough water is a challenge, so I wanted to make an app to help people drink more water.  

Water Reminder is a mobile application designed to help users track and manage daily water drinking habits. Through three main function pages, the app not only allows users to set and monitor water drinking goals, but also view historical water drinking data and receive regular water drinking reminders.  

**Main function**
- Water volume tracking main page (Water Page): displays the userâ€™s daily water drinking goals and progress, and provides a button to quickly add water drinking records. All data is uploaded and stored to Firebase in real time.
- History Page: Allows users to view past drinking records to help them analyze and adjust their drinking habits.
- Drinking water reminder alarm page: Users can enable or turn off drinking water reminders, select the reminder frequency, and set a specific time period (such as night) to avoid receiving reminders.

In addition, the application also supports use with a physical device equipped with a water level sensor that automatically records the amount of water when the user drinks water and synchronizes it to the application.
Suitable for users who are concerned about healthy drinking water and want to improve their drinking habits through technical means, Drinking Water Simulator provides a simple and effective solution.

## Include A Section That Tells Developers How To Install The App

Include a section that gives intructions on how to install the app or run it in Flutter.  What versions of the plugins are you assuming?  Maybe define a licence

##  Contact Details

Having Contact Details is also good as it shows people how to get in contact with you if they'd like to contribute to the app.
