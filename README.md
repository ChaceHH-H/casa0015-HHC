# Water Reminder
As we all know, water is the most important substance needed for human life, NHS recommends that people should aim to drink 1.2L to 2L of water a day. But for some people, drinking enough water is a challenge, so I wanted to make an app to help people drink more water

## Storyboard and UI design

## Include A Section That Tells Developers How To Install The App

Include a section that gives intructions on how to install the app or run it in Flutter.  What versions of the plugins are you assuming?  Maybe define a licence

##  Contact Details

Having Contact Details is also good as it shows people how to get in contact with you if they'd like to contribute to the app.
