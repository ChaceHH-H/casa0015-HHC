# Water Reminder
As we all know, water is the most important substance needed for human life, NHS recommends that people should aim to drink 1.2L to 2L of water a day. But for some people, drinking enough water is a challenge, so I wanted to make an app to help people drink more water.  

Water Reminder is a mobile application designed to help users track and manage daily water drinking habits. Through three main function pages, the app not only allows users to set and monitor water drinking goals, but also view historical water drinking data and receive regular water drinking reminders.

## Include A Section That Tells Developers How To Install The App

Include a section that gives intructions on how to install the app or run it in Flutter.  What versions of the plugins are you assuming?  Maybe define a licence

##  Contact Details

Having Contact Details is also good as it shows people how to get in contact with you if they'd like to contribute to the app.
